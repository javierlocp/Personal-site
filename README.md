# This is portfolio site build by Javier Lo

Below are the tech stack used for this site. Note that TypeScript is not used as I've decided that it is not needed for this project.
- Vite
- React
- JavaScript
- Tailwind

## Goals
My primary goals: 
- To learn modern way of web development (It's been a decade since I last touched`<code>`).
- With the advancement of AI in software development, I figured it'll be great to know what's going on under the hood.
- To document my learnings
- Ultimately, once I'm comfortable enough I'd like to build something useful.
