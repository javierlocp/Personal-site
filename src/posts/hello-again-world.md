I recently decided to redesign this site after nearly a decade of dormancy — not just for the sake of aesthetics, but as a way to reconnect with my roots and rethink my trajectory. My original plan for this first post was to write a deep dive into the how, why, and what behind the redesign.

But as I started outlining that draft, I stumbled upon a word that stuck with me: **_Vestigia_** — Latin for footprints, traces, and tracks. It felt like the perfect metaphor for this site, and maybe even for how I've navigated my career.

Since I couldn't get that word out of my head (and because this redesign is a pretty big milestone for me), I decided to save the deep dive for another day. Today, I'd like to share my journey — and how I got here.

## The Beginning

I grew up in a small town called Ranau, tucked away in Borneo, East Malaysia. The local economy runs on agriculture and petroleum — technology wasn't part of daily life. Computers weren't commodities, and the internet was still in its infancy. (Yeah, the internet came late to this part of the world.)

My first brush with technology felt... forced. Yet that involuntary exposure slowly became a pull — toward understanding the how behind interfaces, the invisible decisions that make software feel intuitive or frustrating.

As you can probably guess, design or tech wasn't part of the plan at all. When I got to college — believe it or not — I was a Science major, but I was way more invested in co-curricular activities, especially basketball. (You can imagine the impact on my final grades.)

## The Detour

Let's just say my report card didn't exactly scream “future engineer.” So I settled for an IT degree — not out of passion, but so my parents had something to brag about at weddings.

For our final-year project (you know, the one you need to graduate), my team built a ferry-ticketing system in `PHP`. The code worked, but the interface felt... _off_. Looking back, that quiet dissatisfaction ended up being my first real step into design.

We barely passed — but hey, a degree's a degree.

## The Year of Learning

After graduation, I gave myself one year — not to job-hunt, but to learn design. The only “design” I knew was what I saw online, so I naturally associated it with `HTML` and `CSS`. Friends and family thought I'd lost it. I spent most of my days locked in my room with a laptop, books, and a whiteboard.

A few months later (honestly, maybe six or more), I shipped my first website. It was hard-coded in Notepad, far from a masterpiece — but enough to give me the confidence to apply to a local hackathon.

They invited me. By the end of the night, the organizer — who would become my first boss — said, "Hey, do you want to work with us?" Turns out, that hackathon was also a hiring exercise. And that's how I landed my first design job.

## Fourteen Years Later

Fast forward to today: I'm still building, designing, learning — and, ironically, finally learning to code, the same stuff I couldn't stand back in my uni days.

This redesign is a reflection of that journey and a reminder of how much I still want to discover.

Here, you'll find a collection of notes, fragments, and breadcrumbs on design, technology, and the strange joy of figuring things out.

A trail of thoughts, lessons, and half-figured experiments I've left behind (and sometimes returned to). **_Vestigia_**, if you will.

As part of that learning and experimentation, I decided to code this site from scratch (okay, not entirely from scratch — I used Vite and React). I'll share a deep dive on that later. I promise!

That said, I still haven't figured out how to build an email subscription system from scratch. I'm currently weighing different API options. In the meantime, feel free to drop me a message at [**hello@javierlo.com**](mailto:hello@javierlo.com).

Thanks for visiting my corner of the internet. If any of this resonates, stick around — there's more ahead.
