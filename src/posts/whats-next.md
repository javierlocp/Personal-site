## What's next

1. About page
2. Detailed case studies
3. Syntax highligter - consider moving to `.mdx`
4. Playground blocks for `code`
5. Move this

## Nice to have

- Analytics
- Lightbox - Click / Tap to enlarge image
- Interactivity / Animations Consider `motion` or `gsap` libraries
- Consider upgrading the markdown parser to something more _modern_, look at what the current `react-markdown` parser is doing for strikethrough: ~~Sentient AI Agents~~ ðŸ˜©
  - Maybe use `rehype-prism`

## Writing

- Behind the scenes or deep dive for this site
- Talk about my cat Genghis (Maybe..)

## Closing notes

These are my scrappy notes. Most of them wonâ€™t make much sense to you â€” and thatâ€™s okay, itâ€™s intentional.
